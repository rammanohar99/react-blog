## What I Learned
- Learned to initiate a React project with Vite, streamlining setup and speeding up development.
- Implemented a dark mode toggle using React's `useState`, applying conditional classes to the body and components.
- Gained familiarity with core npm commands, like `npm install` for adding dependencies and `npm run dev` for launching the development server.
- Built and styled a reusable Header component, enhancing my skills in creating modular React components.
